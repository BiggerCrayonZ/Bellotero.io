# Bellotero.io Installation

Prior to installation, please clone this [repository](https://github.com/BiggerCrayonZ/Bellotero.io).
### Tech

Belloterio uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces!
* [Redux](https://es.redux.js.org/) - Predictive container of the state of JavaScript applications.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again. In this case I used SCSS.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows and Mac.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. 
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components that implement Google's Material Design.
